# Color-Transfer-using-Optimization-Approach

Some digital image processing applications require the transfer of one image’s color scheme to another. 
This means that a target image’s color pattern is transferred to the source image which is made possible through the optimal transport algorithms.
The uses two approaches to solve this problem, one using linprog and other using the sliced optimal transport algorithm.

Note: To run the codes, add the required source and target images as input. Note that the dimensions of these two images should be same. The code will run under python version 3.9.7.
